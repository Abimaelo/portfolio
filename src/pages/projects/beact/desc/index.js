Browser-based VJ x Drummachine x Sequencer. \n
An audio/visual interactive art piece,
and an instrument that everyone can play with
to become a DJ + VJ. It's based on the idea of patatap,
and using two.js, tone.js each as the audio and visual library.
It combines sequencer with on concept of patatap.
We aim to make a interactive album that the audience
can not only listen to the music but also participate.
