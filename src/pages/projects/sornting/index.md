##About

Recently, I’m exploring the idea of using gamification to make the musical machine learning algorithms more understandable and fun. Therefore, I used MusicVAE.js to create this game “Sornting”, which is basically “Song” + “Sort”.

The player has to figure out the original order of the interpolation between two different melodies, and the difficulties will increase as the game progresses.

I’m not trying to justify the result of the interpolation is perfect here. The user will find that some weird effect of interpolation while playing the game and listening to the melodies carefully. It will help the user to not only understand the model but also find out the weakness of model.
