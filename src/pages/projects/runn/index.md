##About

Iâ€™m exploring the idea of using gamification to make the musical machine
learning algorithms more understandable and fun. The first project is Sornting.
"RUNN" is the 2nd one.

Basically, it is "run" (side-scrolling game) + "RNN". The user can play with the
generated output without any prior knowledge about musical machine learning.
Everyone can just play the game and enjoy the generated music. Also, they can
keep the good vibe (the background beat) by controlling their avatar, or not.
All the levels are generated realtime with a MusicRNN model.
